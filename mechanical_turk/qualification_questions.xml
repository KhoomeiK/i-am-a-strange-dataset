    <Title>Self-referential statements qualification test</Title>
    <Text>
    Your task is to say whether a self-referential statement is true or false.
    In cases where you think that the answer is ambiguous, you should use your
    best judgement and still say either 'True' or 'False'.

    Do not use any AI assistants such as ChatGPT to help you;
    AI assistants perform very poorly at this task and so will get many of the answers wrong.
    Although, you can otherwise feel free to search online for any information that would
    help you answer confidently. For example, a few statements may contain a language besides
    English. So, you can feel free to use Google Translate. A few statements additionally contain
    very basic code such as Python code, so you are expected to be familiar with basic Python code
    or able to search to clarify any Python info that you might not know. You can also search for
    the definitions of words that you are unfamiliar with.

    Make sure that you understand the given examples below before continuing.
